        <h3>Why the interest in Iceland?</h3>
        <p>My first exposure to the beauty of Iceland came 
        from the 2013 movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">
        The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>. After seeing that movie I mentally 
        added Iceland to my travel bucket list. In July 2021 I spent a week driving 
        around the ring road that circles the island and seeing as many of the 
        amazing natural wonders as I could. Honestly, I truly had no idea how wonderful and magical this country 
        was until I arrived. Beyond the amazing scenary, Icelanders are very friendly and welcoming. They also teach English in schools so it makes it easy to get around.</p>

        <h3>Travel Tips</h3>
        <h5>When To Go</h5>
        <p>The summer months are when the majority of travelers visit. With moderate temperatures and the fact that it stays light all night long it's easy to understand why. Technically the sun sets at 12:30 AM and rises at 2:00 AM. It made it possible for us to cram so many activities into such a short visit. </p>
        <h5>Google Flights</h5>
        <p>My favorite tool for planning travel has been the ability to search 
            <a href=“https://www.google.com/flights” target=“_blank”>Google Flights</a> and explore flight prices by date and geographic location. With so much uncertainty regarding traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic I wasn’t sure if my partner and I would be able to travel abroad or if we would be relegated to a ‘staycation.’ I found relatively inexpensive tickets to Iceland in early July which was perfect since Iceland was lifting travel restrictions for travelers from the United States on July 1, 2021.</p>
        <h5>Rent a car</h5>
        <p>The majority of the population is centered around the capital, Reykjavik. It’s a cute little European capital city, but in my opinion all of the amazing sites worth checking out are to be found in the countryside. 
        </p>
        <h5>Packing Tips</h5>
        <p>In the summer Iceland is light <em>all</em> day. Bring a sleep mask!
            Bring layers. You’ll need to pack for rain and cold temps but we also had warm sunny days in shorts and t-shirts.
        Bring your own snacks and plan to make your own meals when you can. Food is very expensive there. You will pay
         New York City prices (or worse) for mediocre but not that spectacular food. 
        </p>
