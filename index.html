            <p>Honestly, I truly had no idea how wonderful and magical this country 
                was until I arrived. My first exposure to the beauty of Iceland came 
                from the 2013 movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">
                The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>. After seeing that movie I mentally 
                added Iceland to my travel bucket list.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My favorite tool for planning travel has been the ability to search <a href=“https://www.google.com/flights” target=“_blank”>Google Flights</a> and explore flight prices by date and geographic location. With so much uncertainty regarding traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic I wasn’t sure if my partner and I would be able to travel abroad or if we would be relegated to a ‘staycation.’ I found relatively inexpensive tickets to Iceland in early July which was perfect since Iceland was lifting travel restrictions for travelers from the United States on July 1, 2021.
