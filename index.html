            <p>Honestly, I truly had no idea how wonderful and magical this country 
                was until I arrived. My first exposure to the beauty of Iceland came 
                from the 2013 movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">
                The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>. After seeing that movie I mentally 
                added Iceland to my travel bucket list. In July 2021 I spent a week driving 
                around the ring road that circles the island and seeing as many of the 
                amazing natural wonders as I could. I was astounded by the waterfalls, 
                geysirs, and glaciers.</p>

        <h3>Travel Tips</h3>
        <h5>Google Flights</h5>
        <p>My favorite tool for planning travel has been the ability to search 
            <a href=“https://www.google.com/flights” target=“_blank”>Google Flights</a> and explore flight prices by date and geographic location. With so much uncertainty regarding traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic I wasn’t sure if my partner and I would be able to travel abroad or if we would be relegated to a ‘staycation.’ I found relatively inexpensive tickets to Iceland in early July which was perfect since Iceland was lifting travel restrictions for travelers from the United States on July 1, 2021.</p>
        <h5>Rent a car</h5>
        <p>The majority of the population is centered around the capital, Reykjavik. It’s a cute little European capital city, but in my opinion all of the amazing sites worth checking out are to be found in the countryside. 
        </p>
        <h5>Packing</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>In the summer Iceland is light <em>all</em> day. Bring a sleep mask! 
        </li>
        <li>Bring layers. You’ll need to pack for rain and cold temps but we also had warm sunny days in shorts and t-shirts.</li>
        <li>Bring your own snacks and plan to make your own meals when you can. Food is very expensive there! New York City prices (or worse) for mediocre but not that spectacular food. A large Domino’s pizza there was nearly $35.</li>
        </ul>
